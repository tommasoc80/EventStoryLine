# EventStoryLine

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/92590634.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/92590634)


This repository contains the following materials to extract storylines using the EventStoryLine Corpus (ESC):

- annotated data in (CAT-)XML format (folder: annotated_data). To visualise the data, you have to use CAT (Content Annotation Tool: http://dh.fbk.eu/resources/cat-content-annotation-tool). Ask for an account, it's free.
- annotated data in evaluation format, extending PLOT_LINK relations to include coreference relations (folder: evaluation_format)
- test data (folder: evaluation_format/test)
- Python3.* scripts for creating the evaluation format of the data, extracting baselines systems, evaluating baselines'output

Version 1.0 is available.

**UPDATES**

We have made available the following extensions to ESC:
- ESC v1.2: all plot link relations annotated using crowdsourcing and evaluated using <a href="http://crowdtruth.org">CrowdTruth</a>. Plot relations have been annotated only for events in the same sentence.
- ESC v1.5: plot link relations annotated by experts (i.e., all data in ESC v1.0) and crowd

ESC v1.2 is available in evaluation format only (folder: evaluation_format). Plot data in the evaluation format have been extended using coreference relations from ECB+. 
Complete documentation about the crowdsourcing experiments to obtain ESC v1.2 is available <a href="https://github.com/CrowdTruth/Crowdsourcing-StoryLines">here</a>.

ESC v1.5 is available in evaluation format (folder: evaluation_format) and (CAT-)XML (folder: annotated_data). Plot data in the evaluation format have been extended using coreference relations from ECB+.
PLOT_LINK relations in (CAT-)XML have been enriched with two new attributes *origin* (values: crowd|experts) and *validated* (values:TRUE|FALSE). 
The *validated* attribute signals if the PLOT_LINK has been validate or not. 

As for experiments, evaluation file format are stored in **/evaluation_format/test**:

1) if you want to evaluate only against the *experts*: use version 1.0
2) if you want to evaluate only against the *crowd*: use version 1.2
3) if you want to evaluate against *experts and crowd*: use version 1.5
